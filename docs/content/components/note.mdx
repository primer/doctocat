Use the `Note` component to call out information in documentation pages.

## Usage

`Note` is a [shortcode](https://mdxjs.com/blog/shortcodes), meaning it's globally available in all `.md` and `.mdx` files. So you can use the `Note` component in any `.md` or `.mdx` file without importing it.

```jsx live
<Note>Your note goes here</Note>
```

To write markdown syntax inside of a `Note`, make sure to add extra newlines to seperate the content from the opening and
closing tags:

```
blah blah blah

<Note>

Your _note_ goes **here**.

</Note>

blah blah blah
```

## Variants

### Info (default)

Use the `info` variant to call out neutral information.

```jsx live
<Note>Your note goes here</Note>
```

### Warning

Use the `warning` variant to indicate that extra care should be taken.

```jsx live
<Note variant="warning">Don't forget to give your images alt text.</Note>
```

### Danger

Use the `danger` variant to indicate that something bad could happen if the reader ignores the note.

```jsx live
<Note variant="danger">Don't cut the red wire!</Note>
```
