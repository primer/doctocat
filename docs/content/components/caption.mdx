The caption component can be used to append a caption to images used in documentation.

```jsx live
<Flex alignItems="center" flexDirection="column">
  <img alt="" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos.puppyspot.com/breeds/245/card/500000291_medium.jpg" />
  <Caption>A beautiful husky puppy.</Caption>
</Flex>
```

_Note: Be sure to provide enough detail in your caption so users with assistive technology have adequate context. An empty alt tag `alt=""` should be used on the `img` in cases where the caption describes the image, thus making the image decorative in purpose._
