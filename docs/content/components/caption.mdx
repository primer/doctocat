The caption component can be used to append a caption to images used in documentation.

## Usage

`Caption` is a [shortcode](https://mdxjs.com/blog/shortcodes), meaning it's globally available in all `.md` and `.mdx` files. So you can use the `Caption` component in any `.md` or `.mdx` file without importing it.

## Example

```jsx live
<Box display="flex" alignItems="center" flexDirection="column">
  <img
    alt=""
    src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos.puppyspot.com/breeds/245/card/500000291_medium.jpg"
  />
  <Caption>A beautiful husky puppy.</Caption>
</Box>
```

<Note variant="warning">


Be sure to provide enough detail in your caption so users with assistive technology have adequate context. An empty alt tag `alt=""` should be used on the `img` in cases where the caption describes the image, thus making the image decorative in purpose.
