title: Do/Dont
---

The `Do` and `Dont` components are used for providing good and bad examples within documentation.

## Usage

To use these components in your MDX files, import them like so:

```js
import {Do, Dont} from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat'
```

If you plan to create side-by-side Do/Don't examples, you'll also want to import the `Grid` component from `@primer/components`:

```js
import {Grid} from '@primer/components'
```

### Side-by-side

To create a side-by-side Do/Don't example, you can wrap the `Do` and `Dont` components with the `Grid` component:

```jsx live
<Grid gridTemplateColumns={['1fr', '1fr', '1fr 1fr']} gridGap={3}>
  <Do src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/586552/63106528-06de5100-bf51-11e9-8a5e-98583ed74874.png">
    Use brief and direct communication
  </Do>
  <Dont src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/586552/63106527-06de5100-bf51-11e9-858c-72de6a5c728a.png">
    Don't use wordy and redundant copy
  </Dont>
</Grid>
```

_Note: Caption text should describe the image and be able to stand on its own._

### Isolation

The `Do` and `Dont` components don't always have to be used together. Here's an example of how you might use the `Do` component in isolation:

```jsx live
<Do src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/586552/63046880-46e5fb00-bea1-11e9-836d-be1b1c7d963f.png">
  Use a container class to give the text a max-width
</Do>
```
