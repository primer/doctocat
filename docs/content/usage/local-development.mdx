title: Local development
---

To run your Doctocat site locally follow these steps:

1. If your site is located in a subfolder of your repository like `/docs`, navigate to that folder in your terminal like so:
   `cd docs`

2. Install dependencies: `yarn`

3. Run `yarn run develop`

4. Go to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

If these steps don't work, check the README or reach out to the maintainer of the project you're working on. Some Doctocat sites may decide to customize their local development setup.
