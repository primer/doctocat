title: Deployment
---

When you build your Doctocat site using [`gatsby build`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/#build), the output is static content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. Static content is incredibly easy and affordable to host with any deployment solution. We have landed on using [Now](https://zeit.co/now) for our deploys.

## Deploying to Now

If you started with the [Doctocat template](https://github.com/primer/doctocat-template), your site is already configured to deploy with Now. You're ready to set up the [Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/github) integration. If you did not start with the Doctocat template, before you set up the Now for Github integration, you'll need to create a `now.json` file and add a `now-build` script to `package.json`:

```json
// now.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-site",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": {"distDir": "public"}
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "now-build": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

Once your site has the necessary configuration files and scripts, you can enable the Now for GitHub integration. You'll need to create a Now account, connect your GitHub account, then enable the integration for your repository. Check out the [Now for GitHub docs](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) for more detailed instructions.

After you have the GitHub integration set up, you should be able to access your site from a prefixed `.now.sh` domain.

## Deploying to other providers

## Adding a primer.style path alias

### 1. Update gatsby-config.js

To make your site available from `primer.style/my-site`, start by setting a [`pathPrefix`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/) in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```diff
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
+ pathPrefix: '/my-site',
}
```

### 2. Update package.json

Next, make sure your `build` script in `package.json` runs `gatsby build` with the `--prefix-paths` flag:

```diff
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
-   "build": "gatsby build",
+   "build": "gatsby build --prefix-paths",
    "now-build": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

If this flag is not set, Gatsby will ignore your `pathPrefix`.

### 3. Update now.json

The `--prefix-paths` flag tells Gatsby to prefix paths used in the [`Link`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/) component and [`navigate`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/#how-to-use-the-navigate-helper-function) helper with the `pathPrefix` value assigned in your `gatsby-config.js` file. However, `--prefix-paths` doesn't change where built files get stored in the build directory. This creates a mismatch between the links on your site and the actual paths to your files.

To fix this issue, you'll need to define a [route](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/routes) in your `now.json` file that proxies `/my-site/*` to `/*` so that behind the scenes a path like `/my-site/getting-started` will find `/getting-started.html` in your build directory:

```json
// now.json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "$1"},
  ]
}
```

If your site is located in a subdirectory, make sure the destination (`dest`) of your proxy route is the path to that subdirectory followed by `$1`. Here's what your `now.json` file might look like if your site is located in a subdirectory called `docs`:

```json
// now.json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "/docs$1"},
  ]
}
```

In order to route branch deploys correctly, you'll also need to set up a route that redirects root route requests (`my-site.now.sh`) to your path prefix (`my-site.now.sh/my-site`):

```diff
// now.json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "/docs$1"},
+   {
+     "src": "/",
+     "status": 301,
+     "headers": {"Location": "/my-site"}
+   }
  ]
}
```

This is necessary because when your project lives in a subdirectory, there isn't any content for the site in the root of your deploy.

### 4. Update now.json in primer/primer.style

After everything is set up in your repository, open a pull request on the [primer/primer.style](https://github.com/primer/primer.style) repository to add your site to the `routes` list in [now.json](https://github.com/primer/primer.style/blob/master/now.json):

```diff
// now.json in primer/primer.style
{
  "routes": [
    {"src": "/components(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-components.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/css(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-css.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/design(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-design.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/blueprints(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-blueprints.now.sh"},
    {"src": "/presentations(/.*)?", "dest": "https://primer-presentations.now.sh"},
+   {"src": "/my-site(/.*)?", "dest": "https://my-site.now.sh"}
  ]
}
```

Once your pull request is approved and merged, you'll be able to access your site from `primer.style/my-site`. 🎉
