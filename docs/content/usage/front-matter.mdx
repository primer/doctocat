title: Front matter
---

import {StatusLabel} from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat'

When you create a Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) in `src/pages/`, you can define variables to provide additional information about that page. This information is called front matter and is set between triple dashes starting on the first line of the file:

```
---
title: Example title
---
```

Doctocat recognizes some specific front matter variables described below.

## Title and description

`title` is used to render the page heading and generate the [page title](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title). `description` is used to create a [meta description tag](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) which is important for SEO. We recommend setting `title` and `description` for every page:

```markdown
---
title: My page title
description: My page description
---
```

## Status

You can add a status label to any page by setting a `status` variable in the frontmatter:

```markdown
---
status: Stable
---
```

Doctocat comes with a few predefined statuses that have colors associated with them:

| Status         | Output                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Stable`       | <StatusLabel status="Stable" />       |
| `New`          | <StatusLabel status="New" />          |
| `Experimental` | <StatusLabel status="Experimental" /> |
| `Review`       | <StatusLabel status="Review" />       |
| `Deprecated`   | <StatusLabel status="Deprecated" />   |

Custom statuses will render a gray dot:

<StatusLabel status="My custom status" />

## Additional contributors

If you have the `repository` in `package.json` and `repoRootPath` in `gatsby-config.js` setup correctly (as desribed in the [customization](/usage/customization#contributors) guide), Doctocat will automatically display contributors on the bottom of every page. These contributors are determined by commits. However, we know that commits aren't the only way to contribute. To give credit to people who aren't listed in the commit history but still contributed, use the `additionalContributors` front matter variable to list their GitHub usernames, for example:

```markdown
---
additionalContributors:
  - ashygee
  - emplums
---
```
