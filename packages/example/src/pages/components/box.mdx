title: Box
---

The Box component serves as a wrapper component for most layout related needs. Use Box to set values such as `display`, `width`, `height`, and more. See the LAYOUT section of our [System Props](/components/docs/system-props) documentation for the full list of available props. In practice, this component is used frequently as a wrapper around other components to achieve Box Model related styling.

## Default example

```jsx live
<Box>
  Box can be used to create both
  <Box as="span" bg="green.1">
    inline
  </Box>
  and
  <Box bg="blue.1">block-level elements,</Box>
  <Box bg="purple.1" width={[1, 1, 1 / 2]}>
    elements with fixed or responsive width and height,
  </Box>
  <Box bg="yellow.0" p={4} mt={2}>
    and more!
  </Box>
</Box>
```

## System props

Box components get the `COMMON` and `LAYOUT` categories of system props. Read our [System Props](/components/docs/system-props) doc page for a full list of available props.
